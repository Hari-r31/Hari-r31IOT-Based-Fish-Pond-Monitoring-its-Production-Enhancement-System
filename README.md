# IoT-based Fish Pond Monitoring & Production Enhancement System

This project is designed to monitor and enhance the production of fish ponds using IoT technology. It integrates sensors, communication devices, and data analytics to provide real-time monitoring and control of crucial parameters in fish farming environments.

## Project Overview

The Fish Pond Monitoring System is a comprehensive solution aimed at optimizing water quality, ensuring the well-being of aquatic organisms, and improving overall farm efficiency. Key components of the system include:

- Water quality sensors
- Temperature sensors
- Dissolved oxygen sensors
- Centralized control unit with machine learning algorithms for data analysis
- User-friendly interface for farm operators
- Real-time alerts and notifications

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of water quality parameters
- Automated alerts for critical deviations
- Data analysis for trend prediction and anomaly detection
- Remote access via web or mobile interfaces
- Improved resource efficiency and reduced operational costs

## Installation

To install and run the Fish Pond Monitoring System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fish-pond-monitoring.git
    cd fish-pond-monitoring
    ```

2. **Set up hardware:**
    - Assemble the sensors and connect them to the ESP32 microcontroller.
    - Follow the wiring instructions and pin mappings provided in the documentation.

3. **Configure software:**
    - Install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
    - Add the ESP32 board to the Arduino IDE by following [these instructions](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).
    - Install necessary libraries (e.g., Blynk, ThingSpeak, Twilio) through the Arduino Library Manager.

4. **Upload the code:**
    - Open the project code in the Arduino IDE.
    - Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and credentials:
      ```cpp
      unsigned long myChannelNumber = 2516273;         // ThingSpeak channel number
      const char *myWriteAPIKey = "YOUR_THINGSPEAK_WRITE_API_KEY";  // ThingSpeak write API key

      const char *account_sid = "YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID";            // Twilio account SID
      const char *auth_token = "YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN";              // Twilio authentication token
      const char *messaging_service_sid = "YOUR_TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID";  // Twilio messaging service SID
      const char *to_number = "RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER";               // Recipient's phone number
      ```
    - Compile and upload the code to the ESP32.

5. **Set up cloud services:**
    - Create a ThingSpeak account and set up a new channel for data logging.
    - Configure Blynk for remote monitoring.
    - Set up Twilio for SMS notifications.

## Usage

Once the system is installed and configured, it will continuously monitor the fish pond environment and send real-time data to the cloud. Farm operators can access this data through a web dashboard or mobile app, receive alerts for any critical changes, and make informed decisions to optimize pond conditions.
